## Hello! I'm George 👋

I'm a passionate and creative computer science student at UPenn. I love coding, building cool projects, and exploring new technologies.

Otherwise, I'm...

* ♟️ Trying to reclaim my middle school [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/georgebotros02) glory
* 🧑‍🍳 Learning new recipes (I'm a bad cook, but my appetite drives me)
* 🎥 Creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@dailypenn) for _The Daily Pennsylvanian_

### 🚀 Some Cool Projects

#### 🎬 Transcript Reader

Enhance your video viewing experience! With this project, I developed a Safari extension app for macOS and iPad that takes Safari's "reader mode" to a whole new level by extending it to video subtitles. Now, you can enjoy a comfortable reading experience while watching your favorite videos. But its usefulness extends beyond enabling users to focus on video content: Transcript Reader invites video watchers to select, search, copy, Quick note, and read ahead in the transcript. Popcorn not included!

#### 🤖 Wiji

Learn how to create a widget-style application, similar to Siri, on macOS. With Wiji, I've created an online tutorial that guides you through the process of crafting these dynamic and engaging apps.
